### 3. Explain why the Parquet file format is particularly well-suited for such analytical tasks. Compare it with the CSV file format and explain why, strictly speaking, the CSV file format cannot encode the same data without transforming the original data or providing additional encoding information.
- Parquet:  
    - Columnar storage format, which allows for more efficient reading and writing of large datasets.
    - Supports complex data types and encoding, making it suitable for analytical tasks.
    - Allows for efficient compression and encoding schemes, reducing storage space and speeding up data access.
    - Provides better performance for analytical workloads, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

- CSV:  
    - A row-based format that is simple to read and write but not efficient for large datasets.
    - Lacks support for complex data types, meaning that nested or hierarchical data must be flattened or transformed.
    - Does not inherently include metadata, leading to ambiguity in interpreting data types and structures.
    - Requires additional encoding or transformation to represent data types and structures that Parquet can handle natively.

In summary, while CSV files are easy to use and widely supported, Parquet files offer significant advantages in performance and functionality for data analytics, making them a better choice for tasks involving large datasets with complex structures.
